You Are Still Getting a 429 Error (Quota Exceeded)

The error message "You exceeded your current quota" means that your OpenAI account has run out of free credits or has hit its usage limit.
üîç Steps to Check Your OpenAI Billing & Quota

    Check Usage & Quota
        Go to OpenAI Usage Page
        See if you have remaining free credits or if you've exceeded your limit.

    Check Billing Status
        Visit OpenAI Billing Page
        Ensure you have an active payment method and enough balance to continue making API calls.

    Upgrade to a Paid Plan
        If you're using the free trial, it has a limit. You may need to add a payment method to continue using the API.
        Go to Billing Settings and check if you need to purchase additional credits.

üöÄ How to Fix This in Your Chatbot

If you still want to test without upgrading:

    Limit API Calls ‚Äì Add a delay before retrying to prevent hitting rate limits.
    Use a Backend Proxy ‚Äì Secure your API key and avoid exposing it in frontend code.
    Use a Different API Key ‚Äì If you have access to another OpenAI account, try using a different key.

üí° Next Steps

‚úÖ Check OpenAI Usage & Billing
‚úÖ Upgrade to a Paid Plan (if necessary)
‚úÖ Reduce API Calls / Implement Retry Strategy
‚úÖ Secure API Key in Backend
