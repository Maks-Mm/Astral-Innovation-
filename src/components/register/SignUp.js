      for an authentication and authorization service that can handle user
      sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out mechanisms for your web application. Here
      are some popular services that you can use: Auth0: A flexible, drop-in
      solution to add authentication and authorization services to your
      applications. It provides various authentication methods, including social
      login, single sign-on, and multi-factor authentication. Firebase
      Authentication: Part of Googleâ€™s Firebase platform, it allows you to
      authenticate users using passwords, phone numbers, and popular federated
      identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Okta: A
      comprehensive identity management service that allows you to manage user
      authentication and authorization, with support for single sign-on (SSO)
      and multifactor authentication. Amazon Cognito: Part of AWS, it provides
      user sign-up, sign-in, and access control. It supports social identity
      providers and offers secure authentication. Passport.js: A middleware for
      Node.js that simplifies the implementation of various authentication
      strategies. It allows you to use different authentication methods, such as
      local, OAuth, and OpenID. Magic.link: A passwordless authentication
      solution that allows users to sign in using their email or phone number
      without needing to create a password. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): While not a
      service itself, you can implement JWT for stateless authentication in your
      web applications. This involves setting up your own backend to handle the
      authentication process. These services offer various features and
      integrations, so you can choose one based on your specific needs and tech
      stack.
